### Repository information
In this repository we find the delivery of the practice 2 of the Audio and Video Encoding Systems subject (video part).

We have 5 .py files and in each of them we find a detailed explanation on how to use them:

## **main.py**
This is the base script of the project. In it we find a menu that allows us to select what kind of transformation we want to do to the video.

## **ex1.py**
We insert the name of a video and get its width and height (in pixels) and its bit rate.

## **ex3.py**
We enter the name of the video we want to change the resolution of. Then we enter the width and height and get a new video with the new resolution:

## **ex4.py**
Finally, here we can change both the audio and video codec. As soon as we run the script we get an option to display the nomenclature of the codecs we have available, or omit it.

For example, if we apply an MPEG4 video and mp3 audio codec we get:
